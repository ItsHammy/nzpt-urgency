    <p>Urgency allows the government to fast-track the legislative process, enabling them to pass bills more quickly than usual. This is achieved by extending sitting hours, suspending select committee meetings, and potentially skipping stages of the legislative process. While urgency can be a useful tool in genuine emergencies, its use is sometimes controversial due to concerns about reduced scrutiny and public input. </p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
        <h3>What is Urgency?</h3>
        <p>Urgency is a parliamentary procedure that allows the government to expedite the legislative process for certain bills. When a bill is declared urgent, it can bypass some of the usual stages of scrutiny, allowing it to be debated and passed more quickly than under normal circumstances.</p>
        
        <h3>What are "sitting days"?</h3>
        <p>Sitting Days refer to the days when the New Zealand Parliament is officially in session and conducting its business. These are the days when members of Parliament (should*) meet to debate, discuss, and make decisions on legislative matters.</p>
        
        <h3>Where does the data come from?</h3>
        <p>The data is sourced from the official New Zealand Parliament website, ensuring accuracy and reliability.</p>
